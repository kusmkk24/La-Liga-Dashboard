# La Liga Dashboard

As part of a group project, we analyzed data from over 50 CSV files from the 2023/24 La Liga season. Our team transformed the raw data into a structured SQLite database and developed an interactive dashboard in Streamlit. The dashboard dynamically visualized performance metrics and trends, addressing guiding business questions such as:

* How does possession influence match outcomes?
* What factors contribute to attacking efficiency?
  
By leveraging Python for database queries and dynamic visualizations, we delivered actionable insights into team performance and strategic trends in La Liga.
